# A Language Modelling Approach to Authorship Identification for Online Examinations in Sinhala
This research project explores the use of Language Models for the purpose identifying the author of a given piece of Sinhala writing, using a dataset that has been scraped from articles that have been published in Roar Media.

The goal of the project is to develop a model that can be used for examinations that are conducted in the Sinhala language.
